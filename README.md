Goonj - Material management during Disaster<br>

<b>We Made a Project at Smart India Hackathon 2k19 - Grand Final for Goonj.org </b> <br>

<h2>Problem Statment</h2>
<p>One of the initiative of Goonj is to work with people and for people in the regions devastated by any sort of disasters - floods, earthquake, landslides, cloud burst, drought, winters, cyclones, Tsunami etc. Our involvement is in- 
Providing relief material in the initial phase.
Providing rehabilitation material to those whose livelihood is severed for example giving sewing kit (including machine) to a tailor to restart the livelihood, basic utensils and raw material to someone whose eatery is destroyed and likewise. Our centers all over India, run collection drives for material required as per the type of disaster, regional and local culture. Material need, availability, movement, receipt to the last person becomes quite tedious to maintain. Give us a SOLUTION - to maintain and know the exact material available at each center, what has been dispatched against the demand, record/tally material reached the last location vis-a-vis the dispatch. Account for the material handed over for relief, development activities to the last person at the disaster location. Goonj team in remotest of areas should be able to use the application on the hand held device in online or offline mode. Drill down Dashboards to bring in efficiently in operations. So that Goonj team Pan India is updated situation across all Goonj centers.</p>

<h2>Our Approach</h2>
<p>The aim of the problem is to maintain the flow of relief material between diff centers to the disaster location. To solve this problem we will build a web app that will help us know the availability of materials at diff centers, tally the material reaching the disaster location after it’s dispatch and confirmation of the materials reached. The key features of the web app include:
  <ul>
    <li>Dashboard</li>
    <li>Record Page</li>
    <li>Demand Page</li>
    <li>Dispatched Page</li>
